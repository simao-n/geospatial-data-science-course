# Urban Mobility Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks developed for the **Geospatial Data Science for Urban Mobility** course. These notebooks provide practical examples for analyzing and visualizing mobility patterns using Python and geospatial tools.

## How to Use

You can run each notebook in two ways:

### 1. Open in Google Colab (Recommended)

Just click the badge below each notebook to launch it in your browser:

Colab requires no installation and runs everything online.

### 2. Run Locally

To run the notebooks on your machine:

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/urban-mobility-notebooks.git
   cd urban-mobility-notebooks
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   jupyter notebook
   ``` 
3. Open the notebook you want to run in your browser.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells.
5. Make sure to install any additional dependencies as needed.
